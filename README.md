Practical 1 : To calculate salary of an employee given his basic pay (take as input from user). Calculate gross salary of employee. Let HRA be 10 % of basic pay and TA be 5% of basic pay.  Let employee pay professional tax as 2% of total salary. Calculate net salary payable after deductions. 

Practical 4 : To accept student’s five courses marks and compute his/her result. Student is passing if he/she scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course. If student scores aggregate greater than 75%, then the grade is distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75 then the grade if first division. If aggregate is 50>= and <60, then the grade is second division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is third division.

Practical 6 : To simulate simple calculator that performs basic tasks such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with special operations like computing xy and x!. 

Practical 14 : To accept from user the number of Fibonacci numbers to be generated and print the Fibonacci series.

Pratical 15 : Write a python program that accepts a string from user and perform following string operations- 
<br>i.    Calculate length of string 
<br>ii.   String reversal 
<br>iii.  Equality check of two strings 
<br>iii.  Check palindrome 
<br>iv.   Check substring 

Practical 16 : To copy contents of one file to other. While copying 
<br>a) all full stops are to be replaced with commas 
<br>b) lower case are to be replaced with upper case 
<br>c) upper case are to be replaced with lower case.

Practical  17 : To count total characters in file, total words in file, total lines in file and frequency of given word in file.  

Practical 18 : Create class EMPLOYEE for storing details (Name, Designation, gender, Date of Joining and Salary). Define function members to compute 
<br>a)total number of employees in an organization 
<br>b) count of male and  female employee 
<br>c) Employee with salary more than 10,000 
<br>d) Employee with designation “Asst Manager”
